## Why this directory
The code in this repositroy is also avilable in another directory on github(https://github.com/IngvarBjarki/ingvarbjarki.github.io/tree/master/Assignment2), however
we felt that it was more "clean" to put it in a new repositroy, since the other one is
really a child directory inside a parent directory, which we feel like is messier to observe.

## The Notebook
The python notebook, contains the K-means excercise in week five. Furthermore, it
also contains the code which was used to extract the data for both part 2A and part 2B 
of the assignment
